# Heroku Wake up

A foreground service worker app for your personal/ business phone that will wake up "Heroku" App
based on conditions. It may save free dyno hours.

## Problem

plan. Which is not enough for a month or production. If you want to keep awake your heroku app you
can use <a href="https://github.com/romainbutteaud/Kaffeine">Kaffeine</a> but the problem is that
your heroku app will not be able able after 15th-21st of each month because they offer you to set 30
minutes interval.
